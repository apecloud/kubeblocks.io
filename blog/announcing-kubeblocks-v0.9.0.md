# Announcing KubeBlocks v0.9.0

We are thrilled to announce the release of KubeBlocks v0.9.0, which brings us one step closer to the highly anticipated v1.0 release. This version introduces several significant improvements and new features that enhance the overall functionality and user experience of the KubeBlocks platform.

## API Highlights

- In KubeBlocks v0.9, with the introduction of topology support in KubeBlocks, the cluster building experience has become much more flexible and intuitive, akin to assembling a cluster using building blocks. The ClusterDefinition API has added the `topologies` field, allowing developers to provide various deployment patterns with different topologies. Database users can choose a topology when creating a Cluster through the `topology` field. For instance, the Redis Addon offers three topologies: Standalone, Replication, and Proxy. The Standalone topology only includes one Component - RedisServer, the Replication topology includes both RedisServer and Sentinel Components, and the Proxy topology adds a third Component, such as Twemproxy.
- KubeBlocks now supports managing horizontal scaling (Reshard) of distributed databases. You can represent a horizontal shard with a Component, and scale up or down this horizontal shard by adding or removing Components. This scaling capability will also be used in the distributed deployment of Redis and Pika.
- KubeBlocks now uses InstanceSet instead of StatefulSet to manage Pods. InstanceSet supports taking a specified Pod offline and Pod in-place update, and also the primary and secondary databases can adopt different Pod specs in a database Replication architecture (StatefulSet doesn't support these features).
- Developers can add more custom event handlers for Components! The ComponentDefinition API, introduced in v0.8, includes the `lifeCycleActions` field, allowing you to define various custom event handlers. Building on this, KubeBlocks v0.9 provides more handlers for custom addon implementation, including roleprobe (node role probing), memberLeave (node offline), preTerminate (Component offline), and postProvision (Component online). The expansion of event handlers enhances KubeBlocks' expression capabilities. For example, preTerminate and postProvision can be used to execute cross-shard data redistribution (Rebalance) in distributed databases or initiate registration to third-party HA managers like Sentinel and Orchestrator.

## Addon Highlights

- KubeBlocks supports Redis Cluster mode (sharding mode)
  
  Redis Cluster is designed to provide horizontal write scalability and intelligent client high-availability strategies, in addition to its excellent failover capability. Redis Cluster distributes data across multiple Redis nodes, significantly enhancing system capacity, performance, and availability.

- KubeBlocks introduces MySQL Replication mode
  
  Compared to MGR clusters, the MySQL Replication topology requires fewer resources (only two database replicas) and incurs less overhead for data replication. When there is no extreme demands for service availability and data reliability, the Replication topology is a more cost-effective choice. You can actively switch MySQL replica roles using `kbcli` or trigger a passive failover by deleting specified Kubernetes pods via `kubectl`. If there are no long transactions and large table DDLs, the failover generally can be completed within 30 seconds.

### API  deprecations, and other changes for Release 0.9

- ConfigConstraint API becomes stable and upgrades from v1alpha1 to v1beta1.
- The group of StorageProvider changes and is migrated from `storage.kubeblocks.io` to `dataprotection.kubeblocks.io`.
- ClusterVersion v1alpha1 CRD will be removed in Release 1.0.
- ComponentClassDefinition v1alpha1 CRD will be removed in Release 1.0.
- ComponentResourceConstraint v1alpha1 CRD will be removed in Release 1.0.
