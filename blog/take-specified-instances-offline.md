# How to Take Specified Instances Offline?

In [the previous blog](https://kubeblocks.io/blog/instanceset-introduction), we introduced InstanceSet, along with a series of features derived from it to address high availability and other database needs. In this blog, we will introduce one of these features -- taking specified instances offline.

## Why do you need to take specified instances offline?

Before v0.9.0, KubeBlocks generated workloads as ***StatefulSets***, which was a double-edged sword. While KubeBlocks could leverage the advantages of ***StatefulSets*** to manage stateful applications like databases, it inherited its limitations.

One of these limitations is evident in horizontal scaling scenarios, where ***StatefulSets*** offload Pods sequentially based on the *Ordinal* order, potentially impacting the availability of databases running within.

For example, managing a PostgreSQL database with one primary and two secondary replicas using a ***StatefulSet*** named `foo-bar`. Over time, Pod `foo-bar-2` becomes the primary node. Now, if we decide to scale in the database cluster due to low read load, according to ***StatefulSet*** rules, we can only offload Pod `foo-bar-2`, which is currently the primary node. Therefore, we can either directly offload `foo-bar-2`, triggering a failover mechanism to elect a new primary pod from `foo-bar-0` and `foo-bar-1`, or use a switchover mechanism to convert `foo-bar-2` into a secondary pod before offloading it. Either way, there will be a period where write is not applicable.

Another issue arises in the same scenario: if the node hosting `foo-bar-1` experiences a hardware failure, causing disk damage and rendering data read-write inaccessible, according to operational best practices, we need to offload `foo-bar-1` and rebuild replicas on healthy nodes. However, performing such operational tasks based on StatefulSets isn't easy.

To solve the limitations mentioned above, starting from v0.9, KubeBlocks replaces ***StatefulSets*** with ***InstanceSet*** which is a general workload API and is in charge of a set of instances. With ***InstanceSet***, KubeBlocks introduces the specified instance scaling feature to improve the availability.

## How to take specified instances offline?

In KubeBlocks v0.9, the `OfflineInstances` field is added to the Cluster API to specify the instance name that needs to be offloaded.

For example, the current status of the PostgreSQL cluster is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: foo
spec:
  componentSpecs:
name: bar
    replicas: 3
...
```

If you need to scale in the replicas of this cluster to 2 and offload the instance `foo-bar-1`, you can update the cluster object as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: foo
spec:
  componentSpecs:
name: bar
    replicas: 2
    offlineInstances: ["foo-bar-1"]
...
```

When KubeBlocks processes the above spec, it scales in the cluster to 2 replicas and takes the instance `foo-bar-1` offline. In the end, the instances remaining in the cluster will be: `foo-bar-0` and `foo-bar-2`.

## How to use this feature in an OpsRequest?

The OpsRequest API supports the horizontal scaling operation and from KubeBlocks v0.9, the OpsRequest API adds the `onlineInstanceToOffline` field to support the specified instance offline feature. For example,

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  generateName: foo-horizontalscaling-
spec:
  clusterRef: foo
  force: false
  horizontalScaling:
componentName: bar
    scaleIn:
      onlineInstancesToOffline: ["foo-bar-1"]
  ttlSecondsAfterSucceed: 0
  type: HorizontalScaling
```

During the execution process, the OpsRequest Controller will merge `onlineInstancesToOffline` into the corresponding `offlineInstances` in the Cluster object. Ultimately, the Cluster Controller will handle the task of offloading the instance named `foo-bar-1`.

By editing the cluster YAML or creating an OpsRequest operation task, the offloading of a specified instance like `foo-bar-1` is achieved, breaking the limitations of StatefulSet and better supporting business needs. For more examples of specified instance horizontal scaling, refer to the [official documentation](https://kubeblocks.io/docs/preview/api_docs/maintenance/scale/horizontal-scale).

## Notes

In the Cluster API, both `OfflineInstances` and `Replicas` need to be modified simultaneously to achieve the goal of taking specified instances offline. Below are some uncommon combinations that are currently allowed by the API. Itâ€™s recommended to fully understand them before using, to avoid unintended consequences.

| Before | Set the Offline Instances | After |
| :----: | :-----------------------: | :---: |
| `replicas=3, offlineInstances=[]` | `replicas=2,offlineInstances=["foo-bar-3"]` | `foo-bar-0, foo-bar-1` |
| `replicas=2, offlineInstances=["foo-bar-1"]` | `replicas=2, offlineInstances=[]` | `foo-bar-0, foo-bar-1` |
| `replicas=2, offlineInstances=["foo-bar-1"]` | `replicas=3, offlineInstances=["foo-bar-1"]` | `foo-bar-0, foo-bar-2, foo-bar-3` |
