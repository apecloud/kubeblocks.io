# How to Configure Instance Templates in KubeBlocks

## Why introduce the instance template?

In KubeBlocks, a **Cluster** is composed of several **Components**, each of which manages multiple Pods and auxiliary objects.

Before v0.9, these Pods were rendered from a shared **PodTemplate**, as defined in either **ClusterDefinition** or **ComponentDefinition**. However, this design can’t fully address several key use cases:

1. **Clusters** rendered from the same **Addon** needed the ability to configure separate scheduling settings, such as **NodeName**, **NodeSelector**, or **Tolerations**.
2. **Components** rendered from the same **Addon** required the flexibility to apply custom **Annotations**, **Labels**, or **Environment Variables** (Env) to the Pods they managed.
3. **Pods** managed by the same **Component** required the ability to define different **CPU**, **Memory**, and other **Resource Request**s and **Limits**.

As these requirements became more common, the **Instance Template** feature was introduced into the Cluster API in KubeBlocks v0.9. This feature provides finer control over Pod configuration, helping address the above use cases.

## What is an instance template?

An **Instance** serves as the fundamental unit in KubeBlocks, comprising a Pod along with several auxiliary objects. For simplicity, you can think of an **Instance** as a **Pod**, and and for the sake of consistency, we'll continue referring to it as an "**Instance**" from here on.

Starting from v0.9, KubeBlocks introduces the ability to define multiple **instance templates** for a given **Componen**t within a **Cluster**. These instance templates include several fields, such as **Name**, **Replicas**, **Annotations**, **Labels**, **Env**, **Tolerations**, **NodeSelector**. The values defined in these templates will override the corresponding values in the default template (i.e., **PodTemplate** defined in **ClusterDefinition** and **ComponentDefinition**) to generate the final configuration used for rendering the instance.

## How to apply an instance template?

Instance templates can be applied to many scenarios. In this section, we take a [RisingWave cluster](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave) as an example.

KubeBlocks now supports managing RisingWave clusters. The RisingWave Addon is a contribution from the RisingWave team. For optimal performance, RisingWave requires an external storage solution, such as AWS S3 or Alibaba Cloud OSS, to function as its state backend. When setting up a RisingWave cluster, it is necessary to configure credentials and other storage-related details. These configurations can vary between clusters, so ensuring they are properly set is critical for smooth operation.

In the official image of RisingWave, these details can be injected via environment variables. With KubeBlocks v0.9, we enable the configuration of these environment variables directly within the instance template. This allows you to specify the necessary credentials and storage details each time a cluster is created, seamlessly injecting the required information into the RisingWave container.

In the default template of RisingWave Addon, the [environment variables]( https://github.com/apecloud/kubeblocks-addons/blob/main/addons/risingwave/templates/cmpd-compute.yaml#L26) are configured as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterDefinition
metadata:
  name: risingwave
...
spec:
  componentDefs:
name: compute
...
    podSpec:
      containers:
      - name: compute
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          capabilities:
            drop:
            - ALL
          privileged: false
        command:
        - /risingwave/bin/risingwave
        - compute-node
        env:
        - name: RUST_BACKTRACE
          value: "1"
        - name: RW_CONFIG_PATH
          value: /risingwave/config/risingwave.toml
        - name: RW_LISTEN_ADDR
          value: 0.0.0.0:5688
        - name: RW_ADVERTISE_ADDR
          value: $(KB_POD_FQDN):5688
        - name: RW_META_ADDR
          value: load-balance+http://$(metaSvc)-headless:5690
        - name: RW_METRICS_LEVEL
          value: "1"
        - name: RW_CONNECTOR_RPC_ENDPOINT
          value: $(connectorSvc):50051
        - name: RW_PROMETHEUS_LISTENER_ADDR
          value: 0.0.0.0:1222
...
```

After adding an instance template to the [cluster resources](https://github.com/apecloud/kubeblocks-addons/blob/main/addons-cluster/risingwave/templates/cluster.yaml), the environment variables are configured as below:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: {{ include "risingwave-cluster.name" . }}
  namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}
...
spec:
  componentSpecs:
componentDefRef: compute
    name: compute
    replicas: {{ .Values.risingwave.compute.replicas }}
    instances:
    - name: instance
      replicas: {{ .Values.risingwave.compute.replicas }}
      env:
      - name: RW_STATE_STORE
        value: "hummock+s3://{{ .Values.risingwave.stateStore.s3.bucket }}"
      - name: AWS_REGION
        value: "{{ .Values.risingwave.stateStore.s3.region }}"
      {{- if eq .Values.risingwave.stateStore.s3.authentication.serviceAccountName "" }}
      - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        value: "{{ .Values.risingwave.stateStore.s3.authentication.accessKey }}"
      - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        value: "{{ .Values.risingwave.stateStore.s3.authentication.secretAccessKey }}"
      {{- end }}
      - name: RW_DATA_DIRECTORY
        value: "{{ .Values.risingwave.stateStore.dataDirectory }}"
      {{- if .Values.risingwave.stateStore.s3.endpoint }}
      - name: RW_S3_ENDPOINT
        value: "{{ .Values.risingwave.stateStore.s3.endpoint }}"
      {{- end }}
      {{- if .Values.risingwave.metaStore.etcd.authentication.enabled }}
      - name: RW_ETCD_USERNAME
        value: "{{ .Values.risingwave.metaStore.etcd.authentication.username }}"
      - name: RW_ETCD_PASSWORD
        value: "{{ .Values.risingwave.metaStore.etcd.authentication.password }}"
      {{- end }}
      - name: RW_ETCD_ENDPOINTS
        value: "{{ .Values.risingwave.metaStore.etcd.endpoints }}"
      - name: RW_ETCD_AUTH
        value: "{{ .Values.risingwave.metaStore.etcd.authentication.enabled}}"
...
```

In the example above, we've added an instance template named `instance` through the `instances` field. This template defines several environment variables, including `RW_STATE_STORE` and `AWS_REGION`. These environment variables will be appended by KubeBlocks to the list of environment variables defined in the default template. Consequently, the rendered instance will contain both the environment variables from the default template and those specified in this instance template.

Additionally, the `replicas` field in the instance template is identical to the one defined in the `componentSpec` (both are `{{ .Values.risingwave.compute.replicas }}`). This ensures that after overriding the default template, this instance template will be used to render all instances within this component.

## Instance template details

Each Component can define multiple instance templates, and each template should have a unique name configured by the Name field. Instance template names within the same Component must remain unique.

The `Replicas` field in each template determines how many instances are rendered from that template, with a default value of 1. The total amount of `Replicas` across all **instance templates** within a Component must not exceed the `Replicas` value defined for the **Component**. If the instances rendered from instance templates fall short of the total required by the **Component**, the remaining instances will be rendered using the default template.

The pattern for the names of instances rendered based on instance templates is `(clustername)-(component name)-$(instance template name)-ordinal`. For example, in the above RisingWave cluster, the Cluster name is **risingwave**, the Component name is **compute**, the instance template name is **instance**, and the number of **Replicas** is 3. Therefore, the rendered instance names would be:

- `risingwave-compute-instance-0`
- `risingwave-compute-instance-1`
- `risingwave-compute-instance-2`

Instance templates can be used when creating a cluster, and they can also be updated during the operation phase, including adding, deleting, or modifying templates. It’s important to carefully evaluate the potential impact of such changes before performing updates, as this may update, delete, or rebuild instances.

### Annotations

The `Annotations` field in the instance template is used to override the `Annotations` field in the default template. If a Key in the `Annotations` of the instance template already exists in the default template, the `value` from the instance template will take precedence. If the Key does not exist in the default template, the Key-Value pair will be added to the final `Annotations`.

For example, the `annotations` in the default template are:

```yaml
annotations:
  "foo0": "bar0"
  "foo1": "bar"
```

And `annotations` in the instance templates are:

```yaml
annotations:
  "foo1": "bar1"
  "foo2": "bar2"
```

Then, after rendering, the actual `annotations` are:

```yaml
annotations:
  "foo0": "bar0"
  "foo1": "bar1"
  "foo2": "bar2"
```

Note that KubeBlocks adds system-level `Annotations`, which cannot be overwritten by instance templates.

### Labels

Before KubeBlocks v0.9, labels could be defined in the default template at the cluster or component level. Additionally, KubeBlocks automatically adds some system default labels. Together, these labels form the final set of `Labels` for a resource.

From KubeBlocks v0.9, you can set `Labels` via the instance template.

Similar to `Annotations`, `Labels` in instance templates follow the same overriding logic applied to existing `Labels`.

Instance template `Labels` take the highest priority. However, they cannot override system `Labels` added by KubeBlocks.

### Image

The `Image` field in the instance template is used to override the `Image` field of the first container in the default template.

`Image` field should be used with caution: for the StatefulSet application like databases, changing the `Image` often introduces compatibility issues, particularly with data formats. When changing this field, ensure that the image version in the instance template is fully compatible with that in the default template.

From KubeBlocks v0.9, the `ComponentVersion` field is used to manage image versions more effectively. It’s recommended to manage versions using `ComponentVersion` to avoid compatibility issues.

### SchedulingPolicy.SchedulerName

`SchedulerName` in the instance template overrides the same field in the default template.

### SchedulingPolicy.NodeName

`NodeName` in the instance template overrides the same field in the default template.

### SchedulingPolicy.NodeSelector

`NodeSelector` in the instance template overrides the same field in the default template.

### SchedulingPolicy.Tolerations

The `Tolerations` field in the instance template overrides the same field in the default template.

If the `Toleration` in the instance template is identical to a `Toleration` in the default template (all attributes—`Key`, `Operator`, `Value`, `Effect`, and `TolerationSeconds`—are identical), then that `Toleration` will be ignored. Otherwise, it will be added to the list of `Tolerations` in the default template.

### SchedulingPolicy.Affinity

The `Affinity` field in the instance template overrides the same field in the default template.

### SchedulingPolicy.TopologySpreadConstraints

The `TopologySpreadConstraints` field in the instance template overrides the same field in the default template.

### Resources

Before v0.9, KubeBlocks supported defining `Resource` values at multiple levels: the default template, Cluster, and Component levels. The final resource values were determined through a cascading override mechanism, with Component-level taking precedence. Starting from v0.9, Instance Template `Resource` values can now be defined and will take precedence over Component-level settings.

### Env

Before v0.9, environment variables in KubeBlocks could be set at the default template and Component levels, either directly or indirectly. Additionally, KubeBlocks provided certain system default environment variables through ConfigMaps using the `EnvVarSource` mechanism. These variables were combined to form the final Env list.

Starting with v0.9, instance templates introduced a new way to define environment variabless. The values defined in instance templates will override other Env variables, except for KubeBlocks’ system default environment variables. The override logic follows the same principles as for `Annotations` and `Labels`: if an Env `Name` matches, the `Value` or `ValueFrom` from the instance template takes precedence; if there’s no match, the new Env is added to the list.

### Volumes

The `Volumes` field in the instance template overrides the same field in the first Container in the default template. If the Volume `Name` matches, the `VolumeSource` from the instance template is applied; if not, the volume will be added as a new entry in the final volume list.

### VolumeMounts

The `VolumeMounts` field in the instance template overrides the same field in the first Container in the default template. If the VolumeMount `Name` matches, the `MountPath` and other related values from the instance template are applied. If the name does not match, the VolumeMount is added as a new entry.

### VolumeClaimTemplates

The `VolumeClaimTemplates` field in the instance template overrides the same field generated by `ClusterComponentVolumeClaimTemplates` in the Component. If the `PersistentVolumeClaim Name` is the same, the `PersistentVolumeClaimSpec` values from the instance template will be applied; otherwise, it will be added as a new `PersistentVolumeClaim`.
