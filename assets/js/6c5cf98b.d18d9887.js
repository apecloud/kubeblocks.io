Our discussions with many users revealed an intriguing phenomenon: among offline users who have limited access to cloud vendors, the open-source database operator is more popular and comparable in popularity to Kubernetes itself.\nMany users noted that even though fully managed database services encounter various issues, they are typically resolved through the cloud provider's automation program or the operations team. On the other hand, while the open-source database operator is rapidly improving, it still lacks the capability to self-repair and there is no support from operations personnel. This partially explains why the open-source database operator is favored among offline users as having a dedicated operations team handling problems can be more comforting from an operational efficiency standpoint."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"The Kubernetes community primarily categorizes user roles into two types: developers who deploy applications and operations staff who manage the cluster. Developers can independently expand the database by utilizing the open-source database operator. However, if there is a lack of resources, operations staff need to quickly add resources to the Kubernetes cluster. While they usually understand the resource needs of the application, they may not have a good understanding of the resources required by the database, which can lead to occasional problems like abnormal database synchronization that are hard to handle and cause stress. If developers also handle operations tasks (known as DevOps), the added workload and cognitive burden may discourage them from handling database operators and adopting fully managing the database service instead."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Aside from the reasons mentioned earlier, the inadequate integration of open-source database operators may also contribute to a less smooth user experience compared to fully managed database services. For instance, when creating a backup for MySQL, an open-source database operator may require additional steps such as allocating resources and configuring accounts for an object storage service in the Kubernetes cluster to store the backup file, whereas fully managed database services do not need these steps. Additionally, complex applications often involve multiple types of databases, such as MySQL and Redis. This may result in inconsistent user experiences with open-source database operators, whereas fully managed database services offer a unified design across the console, command line, and API, although the experience is often criticized."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Even though there are challenges such as cognitive burden and limited integration, Kubernetes will continue to improve developer productivity and resource utilization, leading to a lasting influence on the world.\nThese difficulties will eventually be overcome.
